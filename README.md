# Discord-Bot-Boilerplate

11/23/2020 - Hello! This is a template for those who want to create their own Discord bot!

## Getting Started

1. Make a Discord account (https://discord.com/)
2. Go to Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
3. Click on "New Application" in the top right, and give your bot a name
4. On the left side of your screen, click on "Bot"
5. In the top right of your screen, click on "Add Bot". Here you can add a profile picture for your bot. This is also the page where you will retrieve your bot's token from.
6. On the left side of your screen, click on "OAuth2"
7. Scroll down to the "Scopes" menu and check off "bot". 
8. Scroll down some more and give your bot permissions. Be careful, if you allow your bot to have too much access, and you accidentally reveal your developer key to the public, bad actors can use your bot to do a number of damaging things.
9. Once you've given your bot permissions, copy the link in the center of the page, and paste it into your browsers address bar. Add the bot to the server you want it to be on.
